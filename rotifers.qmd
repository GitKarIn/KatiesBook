# Phylum Rotifera {.unnumbered}

A Phylum, with poorly resolved relationships

There are many rotifers identified in pump samples:

*Keratella spp.*

*Asplancha spp.*

*Trichocera spp.*

*Synchaeta spp.*

\--\> *Synchaeta bicornis*

*Polyarthra spp.*

There are other (less common) rotifers that processors include in a lumped category called "Other rotifers."

This information was made possible with information from [Tina Enderlin's rotifer guide](tina.qmd) and [ICF's Rotifer Guide](ICF.qmd).


The following pages will include detailed descriptions and images of each rotifer.

Calanoida, Cyclopoida, and Harpacticoida are found in brackish-freshwater.

Cyclopoids are defined by these characteristics:

-   Teardrop shaped body

-   Antennae short-medium sized (usually shorter than prosome)

-   5th leg on urosome

-   adult males have 2 kinked antennae

Male and Females are distinguishable by size and body form. Male cyclopoids have kinked antennae and are smaller in size. See [Invertebrates of the Bay-Delta Region]()

Cyclopoids that are counted in CDFW zooplankton pump samples include:

-   *Limnoithona tetraspina* adults

-   *Limnoithona sinensis* adults

-   *Limnoithona spp.* copepodites

-   *Oithona davisae* adults

-   *Oithona similis* adults

-   *Oithona* copepodites

-   Other cyclopoid copepodites

Cyclopoids counted in CB samples include:

-   all **adults** listed above

-   *Acanthocyclops vernalis*

-   Other cylopoid adults
